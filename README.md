# Fire-Forest-Dataset
Algerian Forest Fires Dataset Analysis

Utilized the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset to conduct comprehensive analysis on historical wildfire occurrences in Algeria. Employed advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful insights, including identifying key environmental factors contributing to fire outbreaks and assessing the effectiveness of past mitigation strategies.

Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

Cleaned and preprocessed raw dataset to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
Employed exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to identify patterns and trends in wildfire occurrences, contributing factors, and spatial distribution.
Developed predictive models using machine learning algorithms (such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to forecast potential wildfire hotspots and assess future risks.
Collaborated with environmental experts to interpret findings and provide actionable recommendations for wildfire prevention and management strategies.
Presented analysis results and recommendations to stakeholders, including government agencies and conservation organizations, facilitating informed decision-making processes.
